      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a seasoned and highly skilled Software Quality Assurance Automation Testing professional with over 10 years of experience in Information Technology. Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in testing Client/Server, Web-based, and mobile applications. My passion lies in ensuring high-quality software through comprehensive testing methodologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've successfully led projects with a focus on front-end and functional testing, including regression, sanity, and smoke testing. I am committed to delivering reliable software products by identifying and resolving issues early, employing meticulous manual testing procedures to ensure quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in developing Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Hybrid frameworks using Selenium WebDriver, and am well-versed in the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) approach with Cucumber and Gherkin language. In addition to automation, I have extensive experience in Backend testing, writing SQL queries, and working with databases like Oracle and SQL Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skill set also includes end-to-end automation using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG/JUnit, Maven, Jenkins, Cucumber, JMeter, and Web Services (REST). I am proficient in using Postman, Rest Assured, and JMeter for web services testing. Furthermore, I have experience configuring Jenkins as a Continuous Integration server with Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an enthusiastic learner with excellent analytical and computational skills, and I adapt quickly to new environments. I thrive in collaborative settings, valuing clear communication and teamwork. I am confident, sincere, and deeply committed to achieving success in every project I take on.
